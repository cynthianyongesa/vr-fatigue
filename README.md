# VR-Fatigue

**A comprehensive analysis of physical exertion and simulator sickness in virtual reality interventions.**

## 📊 Project Overview
This project investigates the cognitive and physical effects of VR and exercise interventions in older adults. It covers data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of measures such as workload (NASA-TLX), perceived exertion (RPE), and simulator sickness (SSC).
