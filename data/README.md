## üìå Notes

- **Group-Specific Data Collection:**  
  - **NASA-TLX** was administered to *all three groups* at 16 timepoints.  
  - **Borg RPE** was only administered to the **VR + Bike** and **Bike-only** groups at 48 timepoints due to the physical exertion component.  
  - **SSC** was only administered to the **VR-only** and **VR + Bike** groups at 48 timepoints to assess simulator sickness, which was not relevant for the **Bike-only** group.  

- **Missing Data:**  
  Dropout rates and missing responses are documented and will be handled during data cleaning and analysis.
